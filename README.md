# python-auto-guidance
This repository houses the code for RTK-enabled autonomous guidance, ideal for a precision agriculture application.

GUI_Latest.py is the file that should be run in PYTHON 3!!  It will not work with Python 2.
The Stepper.ino file under the Arduino directory should be run on an Arduino UNO, or another Arduino with the same clock speed and interrupts.
The RTCM_client.py is the file that should be run to send correction data to the GPS.
